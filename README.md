New Life Rule (NLR)

The New Life Rule states that once you die, you forget everything that happened to you. This means that, after you die, you are not allowed to immediately go back to the place you died and kill the person that killed you. That is RDM. NLR ends when the raid is over. (NLR does not apply if you are being revived with defib.)

If you are caught interacting with your previous life within 5 minutes of your death, expect to be punished by staff. (This does not count interacting with the person who killed you.)

Do not tell people what happened after death.
Every job in the Civil Protection category (besides Paramedic) have some exceptions. During a PD or bank raid they may come back an infinite amount of times until the raid is over.
New Life Rule does apply when you are arrested. Even during PD or bank Raids.

Common Misunderstandings:

Paramedics do not count as part of the Government/CP (They are in the category for convenience.)  so they may not be KOS by rebels and they may not KOS rebels.
You cannot complete hits on any staff member that is on duty.
All Government/CP members besides Paramedic can KOS/AOS any Rebel they see. (Including the rebel leader)
Citizens (and rebels.) cannot do anything such as raiding, mugging, kidnapping, or countering. They may base/print and kill other people from self-protection.
Hitmen are only allowed to be arrested by Police if they are heard talking to someone about hits and asking them to give them a hit or a request, or witnessed committing murder.
No Roleplay of any sort is allowed in spawn. If you do happen to have a hit on someone in spawn contact the staff team.
No multi adverts are allowed. (Examples: "/advert Raid/Counter" "/advert Raid/Over/Assist" "/advert PD Raid/Raid" Etc.
Weapons are illegal only if the Mayor has set up the law-board indicating that weapons are illegal.
The only place Police officers are allowed to do random weapon checks is inside the PD.
You can self supply as a weapons dealer but you cannot drop a weapon that a job spawns with and switch jobs to use it.
Hobos can only have KOS signs for props they own, they cannot make a section of the map KOS.
The Mob Boss may ONLY unarrest Mafia Members. While the Rebel Leader can unarrest anyone. They must advert jailbreak first.

11. Crossfire can happen sometimes, and if it does, do /advert Crossfire and give your apologies to the person you have shot.

5. Do not lie to any Staff Member always be honest cause this could lead to an even worse punishment.

6. Do not use any ulx command that can be used for an advantage when roleplaying. (When being Off Duty) Only exception is for no-clipping when stuck.
